# In all environments, the following files are loaded if they exist,
# the latter taking precedence over the former:
#
#  * .env                 contains default values for the environment variables needed by the app
#  * .env.local           uncommitted file with local overrides
#  * .env.<APP_ENV>       committed environment-specific defaults
#  * .env.<APP_ENV>.local uncommitted environment-specific overrides
#
# Real environment variables win over .env files.
#
# DO NOT DEFINE PRODUCTION SECRETS IN THIS FILE NOR IN ANY OTHER COMMITTED FILES.
